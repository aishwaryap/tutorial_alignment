two slices of bread of the same relative shape and size, a container of peanut butter, a container of jelly, two utensils (i prefer a spoon and a butter knife but two spoons or two butter knives would work fine; even two forks if you're in a pinch), and a hard, flat surface (counter, desk, table, etc)
