1|Begin by taking out two slices of bread.
3|Using a knife or spoon, remove about a tablespoon's worth (or however much you so desire)of jelly from the jar and spread it out evenly on one side of one slice of bread. Put it aside, jelly side up.
2|Repeat this procedure with the peanut butter on one side of the other slice of bread.
4|Place the peanut-buttered slice of bread face down directly on top of the jellied slice of bread, matching up the slices of bread as if one were creating a nice, neat stack. 
4|Gently press down to make the the two slices of bread stick to each other.
