Open wrapping (if bread is still in packaging) around loaf of bread and remove two slices.
Place slices on their side (not on edge) on a flat surface.
Open jar of peanut butter.
Hold the handle of the butter knife, and use the flat end to remove a small amount (or as much as desired) of peanut butter from the jar.
Still holding the handle of the knife, spread the peanut butter from the end of the knife evenly over one side of one piece of bread.
Repeat steps 3-5 using the jelly and the second slice of bread.
When application of peanut butter and jelly is completed, set down the knife.
Take the two slices of bread and put the peanut butter side of the one and the jelly side of the other together. The sides of bread with peanut butter or jelly spread on them should be combined in the middle of the sandwich, with the plain sides of the slices facing outwards.
If desired, use the cutting edge of the butter knife to cut the sandwich in half, quarters etc.
Replace the lids on the peanut butter and jelly jars and wash the knife.
Your sandwich is now ready to enjoy.
