You need to take two pieces of the bread and spread a layer of peanut butter on one piece and a layer of jelly on the other piece using your spreading utensil. 
Note that the amount of peanut butter and jelly you use depends on your particular taste. 
Finally, you put the two pieces of bread together - the peanut butter matching up with the jelly, and there you have it, a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - ready for eating!
