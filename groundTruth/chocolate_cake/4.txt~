Preheat oven to 350 degrees. 
Butter cake pans. 
Line bottoms with parchment paper, and butter paper. 
Dust the pans with cocoa; tap out extra.

Pour batter into pans. Bake 45 to 55 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the centers comes out clean; an adult should rotate the pans halfway through and remove cakes from the oven.
Let cakes cool in pans on wire racks, 20 minutes, before inverting to remove. 
Discard paper. 
Cool completely on racks, top side up. 
An adult should cut off top of one layer.
With a butter knife, frost top of trimmed layer.
