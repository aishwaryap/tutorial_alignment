Position the bread slices on the clean surface side-by-side, with one slice face up and the other face down.
Using the knife, scoop a large dollop of peanut butter and spread it onto the top of each slice of bread.  Use as much peanut butter as desired. Putting peanut butter on each side will prevent the bread from getting soggy from the jelly- this is especially important if preparing the sandwich ahead of time.
Using the same technique as with the peanut butter, scoop out the desired amount of jelly. Spread it on top of the peanut butter of one slice of bread. Putting jelly on both sides will only lead to a mess, with jelly spewing out the sides of the sandwich.
Take the slice of bread without jelly on it and flip it on top of the jelly of the other slice.  You should now have a layered PB&J sandwich with peanut butter on the top and bottom and jelly in the center.
