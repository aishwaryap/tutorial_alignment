Given that all the necessary items are present, you begin by laying down two slices of bread on the table directly in front of you. Pick up the jar of peanut butter in one hand. With the opposite, unscrew the top in a counterclock wise fashion. Once removed, set down the top on the table. Holding on to the open jar of peanut butter, pick up the spreading utensil with the free hand. Grab a nice portion of peanut butter on your knife. Put down the peanut butter. With the hand that is now available, pick up either slice of bread in a fashion that the top side of the bread is visible. Maintain and open palm w/ finger slightly bent to keep the slice in place. Carefully apply the knife with the scoop of peanut butter to the slice of bread. Gently spread the peanut butter so that it is evenly distributed. Lay down the piece of bread w/ peanut butter on the table next to the untouched bread, peanut butter side up. Now, set down the knife. Using one hand of the two that are available, pick up the jelly jar and open the jar in the same manner as the peanut butter jar. Set the top down and pick up the knife w/ your free hand. Insert the knife into the jelly jar and scoop out a decent portion of jelly. Because the jelly is quite unstable, you practice caution when holding it. Carefully set down the jelly jar and pick up the slice of bread with your free hand. Be sure that the slice does not have peanut butter. Hold the slice in the same manner as the previous slice. Gently apply the jelly to the slice of bread. spread the jelly so the that all the jelly is evenly distributed. Next, set down the knife. Holding on to the slice of bread with jelly in the same manner, pick up the slice of bread with peanut butter. Be sure to pick it up from the sides so that you do not stick your fingers in the spread. Adjust the slice of bread so that it is held on and open palm w/ slightly bent fingers. Make sure that the peanut butter is facing up. Bring both pieces of bread together as in a clapping motion, but with a fraction of the force. Maintain this your hands clasped while you rotate your hands 45 degrees. Remove the top hand, and there you have it.....and peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
