Grease and flour your cake baking pan and set aside. Preheat your oven to 325 degrees F.
Mix together all dry ingredients in a large mixing bowl: flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and cocoa.
Make three holes with a spatula or mixing spoon. Pour the oil in one of the holes, the vinegar in another hole and the vanilla in the last hole.
Add the cold water on top of all of the chocolate cake ingredients.
Start your mixer out on low and increase the speed as your ingredients begin to come together. Continue to mix until all of the ingredients are incorporated and the chocolate cake mixture is smooth.
Pour your chocolate cake mixture into your baking pan scraping the sides and bottom with your spatula. Settle or spread the mixture into the pan evenly.
Bake on 325 degrees F for about 1 hour. Check to see if cake is ready by using a cake tester.
