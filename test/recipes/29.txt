Along with the groceries, you will need a butter knife for spreading, and a plate.
Take two pieces of bread from the bag and lay them on the plate.
Open peanut butter. Using the knife, spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread until the bread has a coating layer on it. Replace top on jar. Wipe off knife.
Open the jelly. Spread jelly on the other slice of bread, once again giving it a generous coating. Replace top on jar.
Take the slice of bread with jelly and lay it on top of the peanut buttered piece, aligning the sides and corners. Take the knife and cut the sandwich, either widthwise or diagonally.
Put peanut butter and jelly back in refrigerator and bread away.
