Using a spreading knife, spread an even coat of peanut butter on one side of each slice of bread.
When the bread is evenly covered, spread an even coat of jelly atop the peanut butter.
After applying the jelly, put one of the slices on a plate (jelly side up) and place the other slice on top of the first (jelly side down).
