Take one slice of the bread and place in on the flat surface.
Take the knife, and scrape some peanut butter from the jar onto the sharper end.
Spread the peanut butter onto the largest plane/face (the side with the largest surface area) of the bread.
If the peanut butter does not cover the surface, repeat steps 2 and 3 until the surface is covered.
Take the second slice of bread and place it on the flat surface.
Repeat steps 2-4 on the second piece of bread replacing "peanut butter" with "jelly."
Place the jellied side of the second piece of bread onto the peanut buttered side of the first piece of bread, lining up the edges.
And, the final, and most important step, take the sharp end of the knife and press it from the upper left corner of the now-joined pieces of bread to the lower right corner in a diagonal line, thus cutting the sandwich into two wedges.
