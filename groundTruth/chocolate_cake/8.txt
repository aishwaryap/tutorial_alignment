1|Preheat an oven to 325 F.
3|Fill a saucepan with water, bring it to a boil, turn off the heat and rest the bowl on the inside rim of the saucepan, just above the height of the water. 
3|This ensures that the chocolate does not get overheated.
3|Boil the water using a saucepan on the stove and then whisk the chocolate into the boiling water. The chocolate must still be warm in order prevent it from seizing.
3|Place the room-temperature butter and sugar into a mixing bowl. 
3|Using a paddle attachment, turn the mixer to medium speed and cream until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. 
3|This process of aeration is key to creating a light and tender final product. 
2|The butter will cream more easily if it is soft and at room-temperature. 
2|Be sure to occasionally scape down the sides of the bowl to ensure that the ingredients are being incorporated evenly.
3|Gradually add the egg yolks and vanilla and beat until fully incorporated. 
3|Adding eggs a few at a time helps prevent the batter from separating. 
3|Room temperature eggs also aid in creating a more cohesive batter.

4|Prepare baking pans with pan spray and divide the batter evenly.
4|Bake until the cakes spring back slightly to the touch. 
5|Baking times will vary depending on the individual ovens and a number of environmental elements, so it is best to use your senses of touch, smell and sight, rather than rely on a timer.
