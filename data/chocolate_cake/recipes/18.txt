Bring water to a boil. Add in cocoa powder. Whisk until smooth then place bowl into freezer to chill to room temp.
Weigh out all liquid ingredients and set aside
Weigh out all dry ingredients and place into a stand mixing bowl and attach the paddle attachment. Turn on low. Add in your room temp butter in small chunks. Combine on low until you achieve a sandy mixture.
Once your chocolate mixture is cooled, combine it with your liquid ingredients and give it a little whisk to break up the eggs and combine things together. Add 1/3 of your liquid mixture into your dry ingredients and mix on med-high for two minutes. If you do not do this step, your recipe will not turn out.
After two minutes, your batter should be lighter in color and thick like icecream. Turn your mixer back down to low and add in the rest of your liquids slowly. Stop once or twice to scrape the bowl as needed. Once they are all combined, turn back up to med-high for another 30 seconds.
Pour batter into prepared pans and bake for 35-45 minutes depending on how big your pans are. The bigger the pan, the longer it will take for them to bake. When a toothpick comes out of the center with a few sticky crumbs on it, the cake is done.
