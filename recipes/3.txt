Crack the eggs into a small bowl and whisk.
Add some salt and pepper, if you like, but do not add any water, milk, or any other liquids.
Heat the oil or butter in a 9-inch non-stick frying pan and pour in the eggs.
In the first 30-seconds of cooking, use a spatula to create 6-10 small cuts through the omelette.
This allows the uncooked egg on the top to flow down to the bottom of the pan.
When the top is nearly set, sprinkle any fillings over half of the omelette and turn off the heat.
Don't worry if some of the egg in the very centre isn't quite set, because the ambient heat will soon cook it.
Use your spatula to flip one half of the omelette over the other and serve immediately.
