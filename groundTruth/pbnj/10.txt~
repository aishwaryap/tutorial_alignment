1|Take the two slices of bread (remove them from any packaging or wrapping they may be in) and lay them down flat and side by side on the aforementioned surface.
2|Take the container of peanut butter. 
2|open it (usually by unscrewing the lid counter-clockwise). 
2|place both the lid and the now open container back down, side by side, on the surface.
2|Pick up a utensil (i prefer a butter knife) in your dominant hand. 
2|pick up the open container of peanut butter in your other hand. 
2|insert the utensil into the jar and scoop out a portion of peanut butter large enough to cover one side of one of your pieces of bread when spread flat across it.
2|Put the container of peanut butter back down on the surface. 
2|pick up one of your bread slices in your non-dominant hand. 
2|(your dominant one should still be holding the utensil with the peanut butter on it) position the slice of bread so that it is lying flat across your palm (still the non-dominant one). 
2|slowly bring the utensil with the peanut butter on it over to the piece of bread in your non-dominant hand and apply the peanut butter as evenly as possible by spreading it in firm but gentle strokes across the side of the bread that is facing upward in your hand. 
2|continue until that side of the bread is evenly covered in peanut butter.
2|Place the utensil down on the surface. 
2|place the peanut butter-covered slice of bread down on the surface with the peanut butter side facing up!
3|Now take the container of jelly. 
3|open it (usually by unscrewing the lid counter-clockwise). 
3|place both the lid and the now open container back down on the surface, side by side.
3|Pick up a utensil (i prefer a spoon) in your dominant hand. 
3|pick up the open container of jelly in your other hand. 
3|insert the utensil into the jar and scoop out a portion of jelly large enough to cover one side of one piece of bread when spread flat across it.
3|Put the container of jelly down on the surface. 
3|pick up one piece of bread in your non-dominant hand (your dominant one should still be holding the utensil with the jelly on it) and position it so it is lying flat across your palm. 
3|slowly bring the utensil with the jelly on it over to the piece of bread in your non-dominant hand and apply the jelly as evenly as possible by spreading it in firm but gentle strokes across the side of the bread that is facing upward in your hand. 
3|continue until that side of the bread is evenly covered in jelly.
3|Place the utensil down on the surface. 
3|leave the now jelly-covered piece of bread in your hand exactly the way it is (jelly-side up). 
4|now pick up the peanut butter-covered piece of bread with your dominant hand, taking care not to get peanut butter all over yourself. 
4|position it so it is lying flat across the palm of your dominant hand, peanut butter-covered side up.
You should now have a jelly-covered piece of bread in your non-dominant hand (jelly side up) and a peanut butter-covered piece of bread in your dominant hand (peanut butter side up). 
slowly bring your dominant hand closer to your non-dominant hand. holding onto the peanut-buttered piece of bread, rotate the wrist of your dominant arm until the two slices of bread are facing each other, jelly-side to peanut butter-side.
Place the slice of bread in your dominant hand (peanut butter-covered) on top of the slice in your non-dominant hand (jelly-covered), peanut butter-side to jelly-side, making sure to align the two pieces of bread so that they match up perfectly shape-wise (usually corner to corner but if the bread slices do not have corners, just place them together so the shapes correspond, with no corners or edges sticking out).
