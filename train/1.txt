Collect your ingredients. You will want peanut butter, some jam or jelly, and some bread. You may also want to grab some butter, as butter can enhance the flavor of the sandwich.
Spread peanut butter evenly onto one slice of bread using a knife.Stir your peanut butter beforehand to soften it and make it easier to spread on the bread slice.
Spread jelly or jam evenly onto the other slice of bread. You'll want to use a teaspoon or knife.
Press the two slices of bread together. To avoid having the peanut butter and jam run everywhere, do this quickly. A good way is to take both slices at the same time and quickly press them together.
