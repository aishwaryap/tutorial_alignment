1.0  :  4 | Pick up both slices of bread however , do not pick up the slices of bread touching the peanut butter or jelly therefore use the crust of the bread as the lifting mechanism .
1.0  :  4 | Place the jelly and peanut butter sides of the bread gently together without spilling any peanut butter or jelly on the ground .
-------------------------------------------------
1.0  :  1 | Lay the two slices of bread beside one another in front of you .
1.0  :  1 | This procedure is accomplished by removing any two bread slices from the container in which they were previously held .
1.0  :  1 | Hold one slice in your left hand , one in your right hand .
1.0  :  Lay the slices of bread side-by-side on a table or other flat surface .
1.0  :  2 | Remove the lid from the peanut butter jar .
1.0  :  2 | This prodedure is accomplished by placing the fingers about the lid at equal spaces around the lid .
0.0  :  2 | Turn the lid while applying inward pressure with the fingers in a direction counter-clockwise until the jar lid is loosened to its maximum potential .
1.0  :  2 | Remove the lid at this juncture by lifting upward .
1.0  :  Place the lid in a place convenient to its retrieval .
1.0  :  2 | Withdraw some peanut butter from its jar .
1.0  :  This procedure is accomplished by holding either butter knife in the hand such that the blade , or flat end , is exposed .
1.0  :  2 | Place the exposed -LRB- flat -RRB- end into the open end of the jar , and with a slow horizontal movement , gather a desirable amount of peanut butter on the knife 's flat surface .
1.0  :  2 | Remove knife from jar near the center of the circle created by the open area such that no peanut butter is lost .
1.0  :  2 | Using the knife , apply the peanut butter to either slice of bread by placing the surface with which the peanut butter was withdrawn to the exposed surface of the bread slice .
1.0  :  2 | Do not permit the peanut butter to touch the `` crust , '' as this will make the sandwich more difficult to handle at a later time .
1.0  :  2 | Spread the peanut butter along the exposed bread surface upon which it was previously applied , carefully noting the previous warning about not permitting the peanut butter to touch the `` crust . ''
1.0  :  2 | Place the previously used knife aside such that it can be washed at a later time .
1.0  :  3 | Open the jelly jar using a procedure similar to the one for the peanut butter .
1.0  :  3 | More force may be required to open the jelly jar , though .
1.0  :  3 | Retrieve the other knife for use in the jelly .
1.0  :  3 | Use the new butter knife to gather jelly from the jar , using a procedure similar to the one described in Step 4 .
1.0  :  3 | Place the jelly on the slice of bread not previously used , again being careful to avoid the `` crust '' area to maintain clean fingers , if possible .
1.0  :  3 | Spread the jelly on the second slice on the exposed bread surface of the second slice , again being careful to avoid the `` crust '' area .
1.0  :  3 | Set the knife used for the jelly aside so that it may be retrieved at a later time .
1.0  :  4 | Pick up the slice of bread on which the peanut butter has been spread .
1.0  :  4 | This is done by picking the bread up in a manner keeping the peanut-butter surface away from your skin at all times .
1.0  :  4 | Being sure that the peanut butter surface on the held slice faces only the jelly surface on the stationary slice , place the peanut butter surface on the held slice against the jelly surface on the stationary slice and release .
1.0  :  4 | Line up the corners of each slice of bread such that they are flush with one another .
-------------------------------------------------
1.0  :  3 | You need to take two pieces of the bread and spread a layer of peanut butter on one piece and a layer of jelly on the other piece using your spreading utensil .
1.0  :  3 | Note that the amount of peanut butter and jelly you use depends on your particular taste .
1.0  :  4 | Finally , you put the two pieces of bread together - the peanut butter matching up with the jelly , and there you have it , a peanut butter and jelly sandwich - ready for eating !
-------------------------------------------------
1.0  :  1 | Open wrapping -LRB- if bread is still in packaging -RRB- around loaf of bread and remove two slices .
1.0  :  1 | Place slices on their side -LRB- not on edge -RRB- on a flat surface .
1.0  :  2 | Open jar of peanut butter .
1.0  :  2 | Hold the handle of the butter knife , and use the flat end to remove a small amount -LRB- or as much as desired -RRB- of peanut butter from the jar .
1.0  :  2 | Still holding the handle of the knife , spread the peanut butter from the end of the knife evenly over one side of one piece of bread .
1.0  :  3 | Repeat steps 3-5 using the jelly and the second slice of bread .
1.0  :  3 | When application of peanut butter and jelly is completed , set down the knife .
1.0  :  4 | Take the two slices of bread and put the peanut butter side of the one and the jelly side of the other together .
1.0  :  4 | The sides of bread with peanut butter or jelly spread on them should be combined in the middle of the sandwich , with the plain sides of the slices facing outwards .
1.0  :  4 | If desired , use the cutting edge of the butter knife to cut the sandwich in half , quarters etc. 3 | Replace the lids on the peanut butter and jelly jars and wash the knife .
1.0  :  4 | Your sandwich is now ready to enjoy .
-------------------------------------------------
1.0  :  1 | Along with the groceries , you will need a butter knife for spreading , and a plate .
1.0  :  1 | Take two pieces of bread from the bag and lay them on the plate .
