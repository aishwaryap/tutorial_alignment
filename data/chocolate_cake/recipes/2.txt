Sift the dry ingredients together. The dry ingredients are: flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and cocoa. Simply place everything in a sifter and shake it back and forth over a bowl to eliminate the clumps.
Stir in the liquid ingredients and stir well. These are the vinegar, oil, vanilla, water and egg. Some people like to add these ingredients individually, but others stir them together in a second bowl and before adding them to the dry ingredients.
Pour the mixture into an 8-inch greased and floured round pan. The grease and flour will keep the mix from sticking to the pan.
Bake at 350F (177C) for 30 minutes.
Let the cake cool for 5 minutes.
Frost as desired.
